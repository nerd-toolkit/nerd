1. Control modi: 
ORCS can be started in two different modi: with communcation or without communication. There exist some key commands that can not be used if a communication exists. Section 3. gives an overview of all key commands that can be used in either control modus. Following - in section 4. - the key commands, only available if no communcation was established, are listed.

2. Camera control: 
There are two camera modi "Hybrid" and "Mouse". The user can switch between the used control be pressing the key: "C" or by changing the Value: "/Visualization/CameraControlType" to the desired name.
In both control modi, the steps size for the translational movement can be changed by using the "+" and"-" keys. For temporarily switching to a finer stepsize, keep "#" pressed.
The following values can be used to alter the view on the scene:
"/Visualization/StartPosition":	The position to which the view will return after a reset of the view.
"/Visualization/StartOrientation":	The orientation (in degree) to which the view will return after a reset of the view.
"/Visualization/Viewpoint/Orientation":	The current orientation of the view.
"/Visualization/Viewpoint/Position":	The current position of the view.
"/visualization/MaxStepSize":	The normal step size for translational changes of the view.
"/visualization/MinStepSize":	The step size for translational changes of the view, when "Shift" is pressed.


2.1 Hybrid camera control:
In Hybrid mode the two mouse buttons control the view direction, whereas keyboard commands control the view position of the observer.

"w":	move inside the scene.
"s":	move/zoom out of the scene.
"a":	move to the right.
"d":	move to the left.
"q":	move up.
"e":	move down.

left mouse button: 
sideways:	turn to the left/right.
front/back:	turn up/down.

right mouse button:
sideways:	rotate scene.

2.2 Mouse guided camera control:
left mouse button: 
sideways:	turn to the left/right.
front/back:	turn up/down.

right mouse button:
sideways:	move to the right/left.
front/back:	zoom in/out of the scene.

middle button:
front/back:	move up/down.

3. Key commands in communication mode

"T":	show/hide textures.
"C":	switch camera control mode (Hybrid/Mouse).
"V":	reset the view to "/Visualization/StartOrientation" and "/Visualization/StartPosition".
"+"/"-":	increase/decrease step size for translational changes of the view.


4. Additional key commands in no communication mode

"P":	pause the simulation.
"R":	reset the simulation to the initial conditions.
"S":	if simulation is paused, "S" can be used to trigger single simulation steps.
