/**
 * Core.
 * The core provides a globally available static instance
 * which represents the entire simulation system.
 *
 * The core provides a number of standard managers, like the
 * ValueManager, the EventManager, the PhysicsManager of the
 * CollisionManager, and corresponding getter methods for these
 * managers. Additionally any other object (must be a subclass of
 * SystemObject) can be registered as global object and associated
 * with a unique name. Such objects then can be accessed given the
 * global name of the object. This way custom managers can be installed
 * to the Core at runtime.
 *
 * The core also is responsible for the initialization and shutdown
 * of the simulatior system. Objects of SystemObject subclasses can be
 * added to the Core with addSystemObject() to get considered in the
 * initialization and shutdown process.
 *
 * During initialization all objects
 * can acquire resources and other objects, as this phase usually is
 * initiated when most of the simulatior objects have been created.
 *
 * After the initialization phase method bind() is called for all
 * registered SystemObjects. This phase can be used to register for
 * Value changes at the ValueManager or to registere for Event notifications
 * at the EventManager. All required Events, Values and
 * otherwise required objects have to be created before this phase is
 * entered, preferebly during object construction or in the initialization
 * phase.
 *
 * Whenever the simulator is terminated, the Core calls the cleanUp() methods
 * of all SystemObjects. During this phase all objects can savely deregister
 * from other objects and release system resources. This is save, because all
 * objects are still available in the simulation system.
 *
 * When the Core is destroyed it autoamtically destroys all registered
 * SystemObjects and thus can be used for memory management. Whenever
 * an Object has to be created on the HEAP without having an object which
 * is responsible for its destruction, then this object can be registered
 * as SystemObject and is automatically destroyed.
 *
 *
 * The Core maintains a Property list that can be accessed by any object to
 * store or read (shared) configurations. The core will automatically store
 * the Property list at shutdown and reload it at the next Core creation.
 * Therefore the Property list can be used to store configurations
 * between application runs, which is useful e.g. to store the positons of
 * GUI windows, the current working directory of the file choosers, and much more.
