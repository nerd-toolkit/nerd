 * done savely only in this phase of the Core live cycle, as the existence of other objects
 * can not be guaranteed during construction time of each object. When the Core is initialized
 * it is assumed that all relevant "persistent" objects have been created and added to the 
 * Core. 
 * After the initialization of each object, the bind() method is called for each SystemObject. 
 * During this phase all objects can register for Events or reference and start with the 
 * observation of Values in the variable repository (ValueManager). This is only save during this 
 * phase of later, because afore it can not be guaranteed that all Events and Values have 
 * been created and been published in the EventManager or ValueManager. 
 * 
 * If at least on SystemObject returned false in its init() or bind() method, the Core's init()
 * method als will return false, which usually results in a termination of of the application.
 * Hereby the Core usually is shut down regularly with shutDown(), so SystemObjects have to 
 * be prepared to be shut down without a proper init() or bind().
 *
 * Because of this drastic reaction in case of a failed initialization or binding, programmers
 * should always distingush between fatal errors during on of the phases - which means that the
 * simuator will not be able to work properly - and minor errors - which prevent a module from
 * performing its not so relevant function, e.g. showing the execution time. In the latter case
 * it is recommended that the init() or bind() method still returns true, but the module
 * handles the missing ressources, Events or Values in a suitable way, e.g. by a default 
 * behavior or by inactivating itself. This allows at least the main execution of the system.
