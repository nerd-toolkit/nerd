	 * BaseApplication.
	 *
	 * BaseApplication can be used as base class for many differnt applictions
	 * that make use of the NERD system. BaseApplications handles the interpretation
	 * of command line arguments, the initialization of the core, loading of values
	 * from files during startup (pre-init and post-init) and provides a thread
	 * with an own event loop, independent of the QApplication event loop used for the
	 * GUI.
	 *
	 * To use this base class overwrite the protected methods setupApplication() and
	 * runApplication(). Both methods will be called while the system is started in
	 * the run() method of the thread.
	 *
	 * SetupApplications() can be used to create all required objects that will
	 * make up your application. This method will be called before any initialization
	 * of the Core took place.
	 *
	 * RunApplication() will be called after a successful initialization of the Core
	 * and should be used to run the Application. Usually this method should not
	 * block the thread, since the event loop of the BaseApplication thread will be
	 * started only after runApplication returned. If you require blocking algorithms,
	 * you should start a separate thread within runApplication and return afterwards.
	 *
	 * Although BaseApplication handles the interpretation of the command line
	 * parameters it is sometimes useful to process these parameters in your own
	 * subclass to filter your own command line parameters now known by the
	 * BaseApplication.
