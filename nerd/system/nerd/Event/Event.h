/**
 * Event.
 * 
 * Events are used to signal events or states between objects. Any object that has access to 
 * an Event can trigger that Event. This will lead to a notification of all registered
 * EventListeners of the Event. 
 * 
 * To use the Event meachanism modules can simply create Events and trigger these Events
 * whenever it is likely that other modules of the system might require to react on 
 * a specific event or phase. Then the Event has to be published at the EventManager.
 *
 * Events should never be created manually. Instead all modules should use the EventManager
 * and its createEvent() methods. These methods ensure that there are no Events with 
 * conflicting names, that the Event is properly registered at the EventListener
 *  and that Events can be found by other objects using their names.
 * 
 * To access an Event users should always use the EventManager to register. First the 
 * object has to implement the EventListener interface. Then the EventManager method
 * registerForEvent() can be used to look for and registere at an Event. 
 *
 * In addition to the name each Event also provides a short description in human readable
 * text, that can be used for debugging purposes or in a graphical user interface to 
 * give details about the function and purpose of the Event.
 *
 * Events support so called upstream Events. Such Events are added to another Event
 * and will be triggered right before the Event itself notifies its EventListeners, when
 * it was triggered.
