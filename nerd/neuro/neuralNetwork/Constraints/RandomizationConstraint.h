	 * RandomizationConstraint.
	 * 
	 * This constraint allows to randomize parameters of the module members, such as
	 * neuron bias, activation, output, synapse weight, etc.
	 * 
	 * The constraint is only executed once per constraint resolver run to allow other
	 * constraints to resolve inconsistencies introduced by the randomization.
	 * 
	 * The constraint can store the used seed in the module as property. With this stored 
	 * property, the randomized settings can be replicated. For this, the constraint can be 
	 * configured to use such stored seeds instead of generating a new random seed.
	 * 
	 * Special case: the randomize constraint is often used with the NetworkAnalyzer tool.
	 * When the constraint detects a value called /Plotter/AnalyzerRunCounter then a new
	 * property appears, that allows to enable its sigle-shot mode. In that mode, the 
	 * constraint uses a new random seed for the first execution and then that same seed
	 * for all other executions throughout the same analyer run. If the counter of the 
	 * value changes, then a new analyzer run is assumed and a new seed is generated
	 * during the next constraint run.
	 * 
	 * TODO: the constraint should allow more control over the parameter settings and
	 * should also include attributes of TransferFuncitons, ActivationFunctions and
	 * SynapseFunctions.
